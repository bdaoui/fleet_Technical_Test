This is a simple React app that uses the TMDB API to retreive a list of popular movies and display their information, also including the possibility to query for specific movies via searchbar. 

The calls are done with Axios and the styling is in plain css, with two light media queries adjustments for smaller and medium sized screen. 

I left the API key directly in the requests, so there is no need to even touch the code. I will say that I understand the security concerns and in a real project, this would be obviously avoided. 



To use => 

1. clone the repo
2. navigate to the directory
2. run npm install 
3. run npm start.
